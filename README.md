# Chewing Gum JQuery Plugin

Bootstrap has a lot of neat stuff right out-of-the-box. However, some elements
depend on a lot of markup and, also, some javascript behavior. It can be a
boring task to add markup code over and over in order to interact with
javascript.

That's what _Chewing Gum_ is all about: some javascript classes that create
standard markup inside the DOM and give it abilities to interact with the
user. So, you don't have to write boring code anymore only to have that progress
bar or even that modal dialog.
